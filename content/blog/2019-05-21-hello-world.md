Hey! What happened to my website? It&#8217;s best not to ask any questions for now.

<div class="wp-block-button">
  <a class="wp-block-button__link has-background has-pale-pink-background-color" href="http://ec2-52-60-180-208.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com">Visit the old website</a>
</div>

^ This link will eventually go offline once the site transition is complete.

**[The old website is also backed up and available at seshan.xyz/legacy][1].** 

The backup on this server works, but be warned: the blog doesn&#8217;t work (this a new server, more info on it soon. It doesn&#8217;t support Classic ASP ? ). Blog posts are in the seshan.xyz/legacy/flow/blog folder. You can also view the images from seshan.xyz/flow/files (not the legacy folder).
