    May 2019 Update: This blog post was on my old, custom blog system. Now that I got bored of it, we have a new blog systems.<br />Just keep in mind that this post no longer reflects how the blog works nowadays.

Hey! 

Quick update to the website&#8230; More ASP!!! If you ever wanted a direct link to a blog post, or you hate reading these posts in a collapsible, this is just for you! 

You can now click the Direct link to get a full page of the post, or enter the post&#8217;s id into the form at the top of the page. 

The implementation was simple, basically a page that takes the id from the URL and then displays the corresponding post.

I promise there will be more interesting posts later&#8230; maybe&#8230;  
Cya!
