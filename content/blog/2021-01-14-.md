This story starts about 3 or 4 years ago when I first got a ThinkPad T60, specifically to install Libreboot. Now that in and of itself was a whole situation (let&#8217;s just say I ended up having to tear the whole machine down, replace the LCD, and hardware flash the BIOS ROM).

Fast forward to now, where I had an inkling to install Windows on the ThinkPad (for no particular reason). Slight problem, Libreboot uses GRUB as a payload, bare metal. This is great for Linux (you don&#8217;t need a BIOS or UEFI or anything for Linux, it takes care of everything itself), but Windows is a big no-go.

Even more slighter problem: I don&#8217;t have the backup of the original BIOS for the T60. As it turns out
