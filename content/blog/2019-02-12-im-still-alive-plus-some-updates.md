Hey everyone! It&#8217;s been a little while since the last blog post so I feel I should just pop in to say hi. Hi!  
  
Nothing too interesting has happened since, but there are a couple of note worthy things: 

  * I got a Mastodon! <https://mstdn.dolphinbox.net>
  * I created a  [website to help people use GNU/Linux][1]
  * I am getting a job! (clickbait, it&#8217;s actually part of my high school&#8217;s Co-Op program)

But yea, that&#8217;s pretty much it. I started semester 2 in school that is quite a bit lighter compared to the last one, so I&#8217;ll have all the time to do all the stuff and things. That is, of course, until Grade 12 later into the year. That&#8217;s probably going to go straight to disaster status real quick when that comes around. 

That&#8217;s pretty much it! As always, see you next time!
