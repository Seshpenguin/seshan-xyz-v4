Hey guys! As you probably know by now I got my hands on a super awesome iPod 2nd Gen (Yep, straight out of 2002). Check it out! <figure class="wp-block-image">

Do you see that? It&#8217;s Podzilla. Yep, I managed to compile my way to iPodLinux! And it worked&#8230; OK. As it turns out, probably to nobodies suprise the performance is subpar.  
Ok so, iPodLinux. The star of the show of course is the 2.4.32 uClinux, compiled with a customized GCC 3.4.3 toolchain. Podzilla is the custom interface that was developed for iPodLinux. Podzilla &#8220;0&#8221; was created using MicroWindows (Nano-X), and Podzilla &#8220;2&#8221; was created using TTK. In my build of iPodLinux, I ended up using Podzilla 0, mostly because Podzilla 2 was a bit too slow. The next part of iPodLinux, atleast the way I set it up was mpd (music player daemon). mpd is a fairly popular Linux program that, as the name implies, is a daemon that plays music! This is where the problems start, though&#8230; the iPod 2nd gen is sadly too slow to run mpd with any reasonable quality audio files. I tried FLACs, MP3s, and ended up the only files that played were sub 128 kbps MP3, and at that barely. So yea, iPodLinux was a lot of fun to get working, trying to scrape up all files I needed from around the internet and finally seeing that kernel bootup was very satisfying. <figure class="wp-block-image">

Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ll be sure to post all the source code and compiled binaries soon(tm). I had to find all of it through the Wayback Machine, lots of searching, and sketchy websites!  
  
Anyway, my iPod now runs RockBox, since it&#8217;s updated and much better at the whole playing music things. It handles FLAC, OGG, MP3, and more at high bitrates! <figure class="wp-block-image">

So yea, that&#8217;s pretty much it! I have an iPod. It&#8217;s actually nice too. I can use it as a nice distraction free way to listen to music when studying and whatnot.  
The audio quality is a really good too, the Wolfson DAC and amplifier circuitry produces a very nice sound. 2002 iPod works great with modern electronic music! ðŸ˜›
