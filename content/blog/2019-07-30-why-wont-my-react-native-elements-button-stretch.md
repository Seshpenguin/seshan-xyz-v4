If you were like me and spent **way too long** trying to get your React Native Elements button to fill the parent width when placed inside a _flexDirection: &#8216;row&#8217;_ view&#8230; here is your solution:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>containerStyle={{flex: 1}}</code></pre>

Just throw that prop on your button and EVERYTHING WILL WORK! As always make sure your container also stretches by putting &#8216;flex: 1&#8217; or setting the width style as 100% (this works well if you have a ScrollView).
