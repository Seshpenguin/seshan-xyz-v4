Considering that I was born in (and still live in) Ontario, I&#8217;ve always been interested in the various services, infrastructure, etc, that keep our province ticking. In particular, Ontario&#8217;s energy generation is actually quite nice.

If you take a look at the page I embedded above, you&#8217;ll be able to see a live breakdown of where Ontario&#8217;s energy is being produced from.

**If you take a look at the percentages, you&#8217;ll notice that it&#8217;ll be anywhere from 85-90% clean energy!** Now, it&#8217;s important to note that I say clean energy, not renewable, since the largest percentage is Nuclear. Thankfully though, Nuclear is a great option with the ongoing climate crisis. It&#8217;s not renewable, but doesn&#8217;t produce any greenhouse gases, and so it&#8217;s a good backbone power supply while we migrate towards a truly renewable grid.

One nice statistic I heard recently on Newstalk 1010 recently was that **since 2014, Toronto hasn&#8217;t had a smog warning.** This was compared to sometime in 2004/2005 where there was a smog warning for over 40 consecutive days. Unsurprisingly, 2014 was also the year the last coal-fired power plant closed.

So there you go, Ontario has some pretty good energy generation (though we may not be nearly at British Columbia levels, they have close to 95% _renewable!_). We are seeing real tangible benefits to investing in the electrical grid, which is always exciting.
