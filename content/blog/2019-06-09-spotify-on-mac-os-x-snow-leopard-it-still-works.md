I have an old MacBook Pro (Early 2008, it&#8217;s an amazing machine) that I recently installed Snow Leopard on to play around with, and see how useful a laptop with 10.6 can be in 2019. One of the things I remembered hearing was that Spotify has some pretty good backwards compatibility.

And yea, Spotify does! I literally just went to the Spotify website, hit download and it gave me the last compatible version of the Spotify client! Granted, it&#8217;s a pretty old version from ~2014, but that makes things even more interesting.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Now, as expected not everything works. While basic playback does, that&#8217;s pretty much everything that does work. Stuff like the &#8220;Discover&#8221; section that pops up when you first open Spotify is totally broken.

But yea, that&#8217;s about it! I&#8217;m having tons on fun with this MacBook Pro, and I&#8217;ll maybe make some more posts about it. Here&#8217;s a fun fact: I wrote this blog post on the Mac, using ArcticFox (a browser designed for older Macs based on Palemoon, which is a fork of Firefox, with divergence, that retains the old UI, plugin system, etc).
