So I have some friends who like Minecraft. That&#8217;s pretty awesome, because so do I!

Except they play the Bedrock edition. Well I guess we can&#8217;t be friends anymore.

**But wait!** The actually amazing [MCMrARM][1] (who also just so happens to also develop the MacBook Pro 2018/2019 T2 drivers for Linux) has an awesome project, which basically ports the required Android libraries to macOS and Linux, and bundles it into an nice launcher to run Minecraft Bedrock!

So far everything seems to \*just work\*. You need to have Minecraft purchased on Google Play (or alternatively provide an APK). Then you just click play! It&#8217;s pretty awesome, especially since I didn&#8217;t expect it to work on macOS at all. I don&#8217;t need to run a Windows VM!
